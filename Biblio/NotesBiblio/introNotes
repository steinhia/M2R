AMORCE 
Au quotidien, nous parlons rarement assis devant un micro sans bouger le reste de notre corps. Cette situation est pourtant celle que la recherche a longtemps privilégiée pour étudier les mécanismes de production de la parole. Or, dans la vie de tous les jours, nous parlons en bougeant tout notre corps et plus particulièrement nos mains.
Les études réalisées essentiellement chez l’enfant suggèrent l’importance du geste manuel dans la compréhension et l’apprentissage de la parole mais aussi dans le raisonnement verbal et l’apprentissage de connaissances (Cook et al., 2008; Goldin-Meadow & Wagner, 2005). 





LES GESTES SONT SPONTANES
Manual gestures are part of communication. We all move our hands and arms while we speak and researchers have argued that these gestures “are an integral component of the communicative act of the speaker” (Kendon, 2004; p. 359). According to the growth point theory, gestures and speech stem from a common thought process (McNeill, 1992; McNeill & Duncan, 2000; McNeill et al., 2008). They would even be controlled by the same motor system (Gentilucci & Dalla Volta, 2008). The brain integrates both signals when perceiving a communicative act (e.g., Özyürek et al., 2007) even though the networks involving the processing of the two modalities do not overlap completely (Bernardis, Salillas, & Caramelli, 2008).
manual gestures are mastered more easily by infants than speech (e.g., Goodwyn & Acredolo, 1993).
Among the various body actions shown to influence our cognitive
abilities, research paid particular attention to manual gestures, due to their multi-faceted representative function and their special relationship to language (Goldin-Meadow & Alibali, 2013;McNeill, 1992). Manual gestures are commonly and spontaneously used by speakers, learners and teachers. They were shown to support language learning on receptive and expressive sides as well as conceptual learning and problem solving (Kontra, Goldin-Meadow, & Beilock, 2012; Novack & Goldin-Meadow, 2015).
In a daily basis, people are spontaneously gesturing in order to communicate. These gestures can mark the rhythm of the discourse, strengthen the message or provide additional information to the listener.
gestures could represent “a second channel that makes successful comprehension more likely” (Goldin-Meadow & Alibali, 2013, p.261).
The effect of gestures on language comprehension however depends on the information contained in the gestures (Goldin-Meadow & Alibali, 2013)





EMBODIED COGNITION
- les fonctions cognitives
anatomy = topic in embodied cognition because subject directly linked to body
Our study investigated the effect of a direct implication of the motor system when learning structural and functional anatomy. The results suggest that “doing gestures” is more effective than just “seeing gestures” while learning the names of anatomical structures. Such effect was previously observed at short-term in a mental rotation task (Goldin-Meadow et al., 2012) and is consistent with the idea that “motor information accrued by the body can affect learning and development by grounding mental representations in motor areas of the cortex and structuring associated perception” (Kontra, Goldin-
Meadow, & Beilock, 2012; p732).
The movements we make do not only act on the outer world but they also shape our cognitive abilities. A broad range of neurological and behavioral evidences suggest that the motor system is involved in perception, decision making, lexical representation, memory and emotional processes (Barsalou, 2008; Casasanto & Dijkstra, 2010; Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002; Tyler et al., 2003; Wexler,Kosslyn, & Berthoz, 1998).
cf. Barsalou, 2008; Borghi & Pecher, 2011; Clark, 1999; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1993;According to the embodied cognition framework, mental functions are grounded in
sensory-motor processes linked to specific situations (“grounded cognition”, see Barsalou, 2008). Therefore, cognitive representations are not amodal but rather “grounded” in the sensory-motor processes involved in their construction. In knowledge acquisition, as in all experiences, “the brain captures states across the modalities and integrates them with a multimodal representation stored in memory” (Barsalou, 2008, p.618). Wilson, 2002)
A growing amount of behavioral and neurophysiological research shows the implication of limb movements in cognitive activities. For example, manual gestures facilitate learning abstract knowledge such as mathematical concepts (Cook et al., 2008; Perry et al., 1988; GoldinEMeadow and Wagner, 2005); 
- simulation 
Dans le cadre de la cognition incarnée et située, nous adoptons l’idée que la majorité de nos activités cognitives sont une ‘réactivation d’états perceptifs, moteurs et introspectifs acquis durant une expérience avec le monde, le corps et la pensée’(‘Simulation is the reenactment of perceptual, motor, and introspective states acquired during experience with the world, body, and mind’, Barsalou, 2008, p. 618).
language understanding involves motor areas in the brain (e.g., Pulvermüller et al., 2005) and motor systems interact with language comprehension (Glenberg and Kaschak, 2002). In the ‘grounded’ cognition framework, these results are integrated as evidence that most of our cognitive activities are a “reenactment of perceptual, motor, and introspective states acquired during experience with the world, body, and mind” also called “simulation” (Barsalou, 2008, p. 618; see also Varela et al., 1993; Clark, 

- la parole en particulier 
The dynamical system involved in speech is anatomically and functionally distinct from the one of arms and legs. But when producing, addressing or rehabilitating spoken language, the whole motor body actually plays a role or could be trained to play it. 
En particulier, l’activité corporelle qui advient avec la parole et que nous qualifierons de « substrat corporel » (ou « body ground » par écho au terme de « grounded cognition » employé par Barsalou), devient un acteur incontournable, et dont l’étude requiert une bidirectionnalité entre les sciences du langage et les sciences du mouvement, au cœur de notre projet.
Ce substrat corporel peut s’envisager sous l’angle de la contrainte situationnelle (mains libres, mains prises, activité manuelle ou de locomotion, effort physique plus ou moins soutenu),
- plus précisément les mains et la parole
Previous work suggests an embodiment of spoken language in limb movements at both conceptual and motor levels. Empirical observations suggest complex, adaptable and scalable links between the two systems. These dynamical aspects of speechElimb connection were yet poorly integrated in theories and models of speechEmotion interactions.  The breathing system, which is a shared physiological resource between limbs and speech, has however not been systematically investigated as a potential connector between the two systems. addresses the connection between spoken language and both nonEcommunicative (cyclical motions with the arms vs. the legs) and communicative motions (coEspeech hand/arm gestures).
Il intégrerait aussi un troisième acteur encore trop souvent négligé dans l’étude de la parole : la respiration, ressource partagée entre la production de la parole et les mouvements des membres. La respiration pourrait d’abord jouer un rôle de coordinateur entre la parole et le mouvement des membres et de cette coordination pourrait dépendre les capacités d’expression et d’apprentissage verbaux. Elle jouerait aussi un rôle dans la mémorisation des informations puisque l’oxygénation des organes, incluant le cerveau dépend d’elle.
These approaches change the perspectives on cognitive abilities, and language in particular (Lakoff, 2012; Glenberg, 2015): to improve our understanding of spoken language, research should embrace the body’s states and situations in which they occur. Learning and memory are core phenomena in this process, leading to a better understanding of the path from experience to cognition. 
Some earlier studies already integrated the physical properties of the speech motor system as a determinant of spoken languages and, in particular, phonological systems (Ohala, 1978; Liljencrants & Lindblom, 1972; Lindblom, 1984). In general, physical properties are still poorly integrated in phonology, pragmatics, syntax or motor control models of speech production (Bohland et al., 2010). 
Body states accompanying spoken language are manifold and occur at different levels. Speech is often produced while moving the arms or the legs for nonEcommunicative (e.g., talking with a friend while walking on the way to work), or communicative purposes (e.g., pointing to a place or an object). 
Previous work showed that these coEoccurrences lead speech and limbs to influence each other. Moving and talking at the same time could be seen as a dual task, especially when limb motions do not serve a communication purpose or when they convey a concurrent message. But they could also be seen as a context integrated in the motor and lexical learning of spoken language and later ‘reenacted’. 
For some authors, speech and manual gestures are integrated in communication (McNeill, 1992). Manual gestures have actually been hypothesized to be precursors of spoken communication (Corballis, 2003; Glenberg and Gallese, 2012).





LIEN GESTES/LANGAGE
Early gestures do not only predict the lexical items, they also predict the vocabulary range (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005)
Gesture use is predictive of later vocabulary size (Rowe, Özçalışkan, & Goldin-Meadow, 2008). -> choix !!
Taken together, this research suggests that children naturally produce manual gestures to communicate and that these gestures play a role in language acquisition, not only before speech onset but also later (Özçalışkan & Goldin-Meadow, 2005).
To learn a new word, one has to map both a meaning and a lexical form to a concept, which can be respectively labeled as semantic and lexical learning. “Word learning is a complex task that requires (…) to create new semantic and lexical representations, then link these new representations and integrate them with existing phonological, lexical, and semantic representations” (Kapalková, Polišenská, & Süssová, 2016, p. 59).



LES GESTES AIDENT À APPRENDRE EN GENERAL
Manual gestures can facilitate problem solving but also language or conceptual learning. Both seeing and making the gestures seems to be beneficial to cognitive tasks and learning. 
Chen (1996) have shown that gesturing while speaking could facilitate access to the mental lexicon in spontaneous speech produced by undergraduate students (Rauscher, Krauss, & Chen, 1996)
adults can learn a second language easier if they gesture during learning (Gullberg, 2006; McCafferty, 2004)
the teacher’s gestures is already helpful for learning (Cook et al., 2013) 
manual gestures vs pictures -> mieux gesture group Kapalková, Polišenská and Süssová (2016) 
Booth, McGregor and Rohlfing (2008) 1. using pointing to the object to learn its label; 2. additionally touching it; 3. additionally moving it across the table (in TD children) -> avantage pointing comparé a word alone, pas les 2 autres
Singer & Goldin-Meadow (2005) found that seeing gestures during a lesson of mathematics improves performance 24 hours after the lesson and tends to facilitate transfer to other problems solving.gestures should convey supplemental information to verbal information to be helpful: when children learn mathematics, they only improved when the teachers’ gestures bring a different way to approach the problem than the teacher’s spoken message.
Gestures have indeed been shown to promote the learning of words in a foreign language in children (Tellier, 2008 but see Rowe, Silverman, & Mullan, 2013) and adults (Macedonia & von Kriegstein, 2012; Kelly et al., 2014; Macedonia & Repetto, 2016) 
manual gestures vs pictures -> mieux gesture group Kapalková, Polišenská and Süssová (2016) 



ON APPREND MIEUX SI ON FAIT PLUS DE GESTES
For instance, in Church & Goldin-Meadow (1986), children had to explain their understanding of the concept of conservation while judging the same amount of water poured into two glasses with different shapes. When they explained their reasoning to solve the problem, some of them spontaneously produced gestures matching their reasoning while others produced gestures mismatching their reasoning. The latters were more likely to understand their mistakes, and better improve their performance than the formers.
Hanoi : (Trofatter, Kontra, Beilock, & Goldin-Meadow, 2014) The students who made gestures during their explanation showed a greater improvement when they solved the Tower of Hanoi again than those who did not make gestures.
Students who gestured during learning had better performance than those who did not, both for the terminology (“knowledge of specific definitions and labels”) and comprehension (understanding of the structures and functions of the heart) tests (Macken & Ginns, 2014; p 598).
Some interesting observations come from studies in which imitation was not forced and which analyzed the correlation between imitation and word learning performances. In Bird et al. (2000), the participants were not required to, but could, imitate the gestures during training. Correlational analysis showed no correlation between imitation vs. none and word learning performance for children with T21, but did find moderate to high correlation for TD children
In a nutshell, producing the manual gesture during training does not appear to be absolutely necessary since several studies find a gestural advantage even if the children only observed the gesture during training. A few, but not all, studies however showed a positive correlation between production of the manual gesture during training and better word learning performances.


DANS LA DUREE, ICONICITE IMPORTE
Mollink, Hermans and Knoors (2008) found a positive effect of adding signs to words for receptive word learning in hearing impaired children. They analyzed this effect as a function of sign iconicity. Even though the effect was the same for signs with strong iconicity than for those with weak iconicity one week after training, the results after five weeks show that learning was better for strongly iconic signs. The interesting thing is that at five weeks, the performance decreased compared to one week only for weakly iconic signs but remained the same for strongly iconic signs suggesting that iconicity helped longer memory retention.
Capone Singleton (2012) compared iconic gestures underlying shape to pointing. She found that shape gestures were more efficient in promoting expressive and receptive word learning than pointing.
Overall, the studies reviewed here suggest that different types of manual gestures can have differential effects. Pointing gestures appear to be helpful for word learning compared to no gesture even though there is some evidence that gestures having an iconic resemblance with the referent would be more effective. 




ACTIVE LEARNING
being active during learning is an important element in the research about learning and memory: Should learners gesture themselves or is seeing the teacher’s gestures enough?
Evidence suggesting that action itself rather than attention supports active learning is provided by Meijer & Van der Lubbe (2011): an active exploration of 3D objects leads to a better recognition of these objects than a passive exploration, even if participants had to carry out a secondary task during learning

- faire des gestes pendant l'apprentissage en général
Make gestures to learn: Reproducing gestures improves the learning of
anatomical knowledge more than just seeing gestures -> postdoc Amélie
Previous work also suggests that being active during learning of anatomy improve the feeling of involvement, especially when innovative methods are used (cf. Sugan et al., 2010)
- pour l'apprentissage des langues : pendant le training
Some studies have indeed shown that imitating the gesture during training improves the beneficial effect of manual gestures for learning words in a foreign language (e.g., Macedonia, Bergmann, & Roithmayr, 2014). 

- pas toujours un effet
de Nooijer and colleagues (2014) tested receptive verb learning and included both a condition in which participants only observed the gesture and one in which they were also asked to imitate the gesture. They did not find any advantage of imitating the gesture rather than just seeing it.

- au moment du test
 Production of the gesture during testing could also yield better recall performance
It could also be the case that producing the gesture upon recall could facilitate the latter. Only one study directly controlled for gesture production during testing. O’Neill, Topolovec and Stern-Cavalcante (2002) found a positive correlation between descriptive gesture production during testing and receptive performance in TD children only for two out of the five adjectives learned in experiment 1 but for all adjectives in experiment 2.
Some interesting observations come from studies in which imitation was not forced and which analyzed the correlation between imitation and word learning performances. In Bird et al. (2000), the participants were not required to, but could, imitate the gestures during training.Correlational analysis of  correlation between imitation vs. none and word learning performance, showed  moderate to high correlation for TD children.



TRANSITION
Furthermore, the participants in the Gesture group were not only better than
those of the Control group: they also significantly improved their scores as compared with short-term assessment. over time.





EFFETS DES GESTES SURTOUT A LONG TERME -> enlever 1
- gestures make learning last
long-term effect of gestures on learning (Cook et al., 2008). gestures “make learning last” (Cook et al., 2008). could be related to effects of sleep on memory. Literature broadly reported positive effect of sleep on memory consolidation (Diekelmann & Born, 2010; Rasch & Born, 2013)
- surtout quand iconicite
Mollink, Hermans and Knoors (2008) compared word learning performances after one and five weeks. They found a gestural advantage but no differential effect between strong and weak iconicity signs after one week. After five weeks, performance decreased but only for weak iconicity gestures and not for strong iconicity ones. This suggests that iconicity favors longer memorization.
- par rapport aux images, surtout dans le temps -> plus efficaces pour maintenir qu'img
McGregor and colleagues (2009) compared the learning of the preposition ‘under’ in three groups of TD children: one with the word only, one with an additional manual gesture, and one with a photograph. The results show that performance improved from pre-test to immediate testing after training to a similar extent in all groups. A further analysis, however, showed a manual gesture advantage when comparing performance at pre-test and delayed postest. This suggests that manual gestures promote learning more than photographs, not immediately after training, but after a two- to three-day delay. Manual gestures would thus be more efficient for maintaining word learning over time.
It appears that the gesture plays a different role than other additional cues such as pictures.
???
Finally van Berkel-van Hoof and colleagues (2016) found that the gestural advantage grew over time


LIEN AVEC LE SPORT
the effect of physical effort on speech production 
- propriétés de la parole affectées
Physical effort affects the phonetic and phonological properties of speech A clear effect has been observed on prosody. Skutella et al. (2014) found that in faceEtoEface inEdoor biking involving an instructor and a trainee, pitch and verbal rhythm were congruent with posture and movement tempo of the trainer. 
- dual tasks pour comprendre intéraction
Dual task paradigms involving limb movements and speech production provide additional information to understand the interaction of the two systems.
- ralentit le système
In general, even if dual tasks studies are manifold they often show a lower cognitive processing speed and slower motion in comparison to comparable single tasks (for a comprehensive review, see AlEYahya et al., 2011). 
- aident à l'accès au lexique mental
In the Lexical Access Theory, Krauss (1998) postulated that motoric gestures help in the retrieval of words from memory, something which is supported by evidence from several studies. 
- pour l'apprentissage de nouveaux mots
Ravizza (2003) found that, when learning rare words, hand tapping during the recall phase favours word retrieval, as compared with being immobile during this phase. 
- le vélo précisément et l'apprentissage de nouveaux mots
SchmidtEKassow et al. (2010) compared learning and memorizing the vocabulary of a new language while sitting or biking or walking (SchmidtEKassow et al. 2014). After several sessions of learning, the findings reveal an improved memory of the newly learned vocabulary as well as changes in brain plasticity.
Il semble en particulier que l’activité physique pourrait avoir un effet bénéfique sur l’apprentissage (Schmidt-Kassow et al., 2010).
 
HYPOTHESES EXPLICATIVES : ATTENTION GETTER, SLEEP, MEMORY, GROUNDED COGNITION, COGNITIVE LOAD MINIMIZATION
1/ attention getter ?
Joint attention (Tomasello, Carpenter, & Liszkowski, 2007), which is important for learning, would be enhanced by the gesture
Put together, all this evidence suggests that either gestures have an additional role than just attracting the learner’s attention, even more so for iconic representational gestures, or that gestures attract attention more than other cues as hypothesized by McGregor and colleagues (2009): “gestures are interesting, and thus draw more attention to moments of training” (p. 822).
Kapalková, Polišenská and Süssová (2016) found that providing a manual iconic gesture during training yielded better expressive learning performances compared to providing a picture.
This suggests that there is something more to manual gestures than just drawing attention to the word learning context.
2/ sleep pour effet à long terme
Therefore, one or two nights of sleep could enhance memory traces by a (re)-simulation of experience (reactivation in the hippocampus) and a reorganization of the memory traces (by the dialogue between hippocampus and neocortex).
Sleep has a beneficial effect both on declarative and procedural memory (Plihal & Born, 1997; Rasch & Born, 2013).
3/ memory
All these studies suggest that when manual gestures are present during encoding of the memory, it is better encoded. 
Manual gestures could function as additional traces to help the learner memorize the new words more efficiently.
The difference between the two groups also suggests that “seeing gestures” vs. “doing gestures” create different memory traces. -> postdoc Amélie
4/grounded cognition
Short-term subjective evaluations suggest that the Gesture group felt more engaged in the lecture than the Control group -> PD Amélie

These links and mutual adaptations are, however, still not well understood. Our analysis is that transversal integrated approaches are missing in previous work.
language and on “grounded” approaches of cognition. It will contribute to a better understanding of these influences, their adaptability and learning through the study of adult populations with different profiles, and through the exploration of nonEcommunicative and communicative motions. 
Communicative and nonEcommunicative limb movements, arm vs. leg movements were discussed separately but not very often compared.  Developing an integrated approach of these different levels is now required to embrace the complexity of the link 
between spoken language and limb movements.
Evidence for the complex, adaptable and scalable links between spoken language and limb movements comes from interdisciplinary research, with different aims and methods. This provides an interdisciplinary scientific background to the project, of which the first innovation is to connect these areas 
PROJET
Le but général du projet est d’interroger comment les mouvements des membres supérieurs et inférieurs et la respiration interagissent avec : (1) la production de la parole et (2) l’apprentissage de nouvelles informations et en particulier de nouveaux mots
En étudiant les interactions parole-respiration-mouvements des membres au niveau de la production de la parole et de la mémorisation de nouvelles informations, nous contribuerons à une meilleure compréhension du rôle des fonctions motrices et physiologiques dans la communication verbale. Au delà de son importance fondamentale, cette compréhension est requise pour développer des protocoles d’éducation et de rééducation de la parole s’appuyant sur le corps, tels que ceux qui existent déjà mais qui sont encore sous-utilisés du fait d’un manque de validation empirique et de support objectif.
(1) la production de la parole, en étudiant l’effet de différents types de mouvements sur la production de la parole à différents niveaux linguistiques ; et (2) l’apprentissage d’informations verbales, en étudiant l’évolution de la mémorisation d’informations sur plusieurs sessions dans des tâches de narration incluant des nouveaux mots. Une partie du projet est aussi dédiée à l’analyse des gestes spontanés accompagnant la parole afin de les caractériser par des paramètres cinématiques et pouvoir étudier leur relation avec la parole et la respiration.
PWP2 will focus on learning to produce and memorize novel words (object names) with different phonology (new language) or pseudoEwords by: 
(1) investigating how different kind of limb movements (cyclical motion with the arm vs. the legs vs. iconic gestures related to the shape of the object) produced while learning new words affect the way these words are produced (motor learning) and memorized; 
(2) studying the coEevolution of speech and motion in the course of learning; 
(3) analyzing if and how, when both speech and limb motor systems are impaired (Down 
Syndrome), limb movements could still support speech learning and memorization of new 
words.
analyses of different parameters of speech production, based mainly on acoustical recordings . The project will also analyze different linguistic levels, including syntactic structure and vocabulary. 





HYPOTHESES
    (2) Les mouvements du corps font partie du contexte dans lequel nous nous exprimons : leurs variations auraient un impact sur la forme et le contenu de notre parole modulés par la négociation respiratoire entre contrôle de la parole et le contrôle des mouvements des membres. 
    (3) Le fait de bouger les membres pourrait améliorer la mémoire à long terme de la narration d’un événement et l’apprentissage d’un nouveau vocabulaire. En effet, les mouvements des membres semblent améliorer différents types d’apprentissage, ces effets devraient être plus clairs avec la pratique et avoir des corrélats dans les profils de coordination parole-respiration-mouvements des membres. Plus particulièrement, nous nous attendons à un avantage des conditions « mains libres » et « pédalage avec les jambes » sur les conditions « mains immobiles » ou « mains pédalant », du fait du rôle spécifique de la gestualité manuelle dans la production de la parole, une contrainte sur les mains pourrait interférer avec la narration.
Les effets attendus de l’interaction entre parole, respiration et mouvements devraient :

    (4) Affecter différents niveaux linguistiques : syntaxiques, lexicaux, phonologiques, et phonétiques.
    (5) Être spécifiques au type de mouvement (les gestes communicatifs, les gestes cycliques avec les mains ou les jambes) et liés à la respiration.
En résumé, nous supposons un effet positif du mouvement sur la parole qui devrait être spécifique aux types de mouvements et s’observer surtout avec la pratique, sur la rétention à long terme. Nous nous attendons à une évolution des profils de coordination parole-respiration-mouvements des membres au fil des sessions corrélées à une consolidation de la mémoire et à des profils spécifiques de production de la parole à différents niveaux linguistiques.
